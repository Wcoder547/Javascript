# js – JavaScript Learning Examples

Welcome to the **js** repository! This is a friendly, beginner-focused collection of JavaScript examples organized from basic to advanced topics. Each folder contains one or more plain `.js` files with clear examples and comments. There is **no setup or installation required** – just open the code files and start learning. The content is designed to help you understand JavaScript concepts step by step, whether you’re a student, self-learner, or developer brushing up on fundamentals.

## Table of Contents

* [01\_basics](01_basics/) – Date objects and other foundational concepts
* [02\_basics](02_basics/) – JavaScript functions (definition, parameters, return values)
* [03\_basics](03_basics/) – Higher-order array methods (forEach, map, filter, find, etc.)
* [04\_iterations](04_iterations/) – Array iteration methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce` examples
* [09\_advance\_One](09_advance_One/) – Advanced JavaScript topics and tricks
* [10\_object\_oriented\_programing](10_object_oriented_programing/) – Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JS (classes, prototypes)
* [Async\_JavaScript](Async_JavaScript/) – Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, `async/await` patterns
* [Dom](Dom/) – DOM manipulation basics (selecting and modifying HTML elements)
* [DomProjects](DomProjects/) – Practical DOM projects and examples (interactive webpage code)
* [Events](Events/) – Event handling in JavaScript (clicks, keypresses, event listeners)
* [Fun\_js](Fun_js/) – Fun or miscellaneous JavaScript examples (short snippets and experiments)
* [callStack](callStack/) – JavaScript scope, closures, and understanding the call stack

*(Each folder name is a clickable link to its directory. Inside, you’ll find one or more `.js` files to explore.)*

## Usage

To get started, **simply open and read the code** in any folder that interests you. There’s no project to install or run—just the code examples themselves:

* Use a text editor or code editor (like VS Code, Sublime, etc.) to open the `.js` files.
* Read through the examples and comments. Each file demonstrates a concept with explanatory comments in plain language.
* If you want to see the code in action, you can run it in the browser’s developer console or using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for example, `node filename.js` in a terminal).
* Feel free to **experiment**: change values, modify functions, or add `console.log` statements. Observing how the output changes is a great way to learn.
* No special tools or installations are needed—everything is standalone JavaScript.

## Learn at Your Own Pace

This repository is **self-paced**. You can start from the first folder if you’re brand new to JavaScript, or jump to topics that catch your eye. Here are some tips:

* Begin with **01\_basics** if you’re a complete beginner. It covers very foundational ideas (like Date objects and simple operations).
* As you feel more comfortable, move on to the next folders in order. Each set of examples builds on the last, but you can always skip around.
* Don’t worry if some parts seem tricky at first. Read the code comments carefully, and revisit earlier examples if needed.
* If a concept in *04\_iterations* or *Async\_JavaScript* is confusing, try looking at simpler examples (like those in *02\_basics* or *03\_basics*) or search for quick tutorials online.
* Experiment with each example. For instance, try changing a loop condition or a function parameter and run the code again. Learning by doing (and even making mistakes) is highly encouraged!

Happy coding! We hope these examples help you build confidence in JavaScript. Take your time, explore each topic, and enjoy the process of learning and discovery. Each file is a small piece of the larger JavaScript puzzle—piece them together at your own speed. **Good luck and have fun with JavaScript!**
